# Java Learning Journey

This repository contains a collection of projects, coding challenges, and algorithms developed as part of an ongoing journey to master Java. It serves as both a personal record of progress and a resource for those seeking practical implementations of core Java concepts, algorithms, and software design patterns.

## Repository Structure

### 1. **Java Basics**
   This section includes foundational Java programs demonstrating basic syntax, control structures, exception handling, and core concepts such as variables, data types, and methods.
<!-- 
### 2. **Data Structures & Algorithms**
   This directory contains implementations of core data structures (arrays, linked lists, trees, stacks, queues) and algorithms (sorting, searching, recursion). These are designed to strengthen algorithmic problem-solving skills.
   
   - **Example**: Implementations of sorting algorithms (Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort).

### 3. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
   This section covers object-oriented programming principles, such as inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction, through practical examples and projects.

### 4. **Design Patterns**
   This folder contains Java implementations of common design patterns, including but not limited to Singleton, Factory, Strategy, and Observer. Each pattern is implemented with an explanation of its usage and appropriate use cases.

### 5. **Problem Solving**
   A collection of coding challenges sourced from competitive programming platforms (LeetCode, Codeforces, etc.). This section focuses on developing proficiency in solving algorithmic problems.

### 6. **Backend Development (Spring Framework)**
   This section includes Java-based backend projects utilizing the Spring Framework. Projects focus on building RESTful APIs with Spring Boot, integrating with databases using JPA, and developing scalable backend solutions.

### 7. **Testing**
   This directory contains unit tests using JUnit and Mockito. These tests are designed to ensure the correctness of Java applications, demonstrating best practices in writing and organizing tests. -->
